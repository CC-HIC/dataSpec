# dataSpec

Data specification for CC-HIC.
The meta data / data dictionary for the Critical Care Health Informatics Collaborative is held here.

The core and original specification will live on a branch called **core**. Collaborators who wish to work with the data are encouraged to fork this repository, and then send a pull request with a copy of the modifications back to us.

A richer specification compatible with [cleanEHR](https://github.com/CC-HIC/cleanEHR) will be kept here (on the **master** branch) as a easy and quick start for new teams. The best parts of the work from different collaborators will be merged with this.

This might include

- validation checks
  - range thresholds
  - missingness thresholds
  - imputation recommendations
- recommended variable names
- distributions for variables
- labels for categorical variables
